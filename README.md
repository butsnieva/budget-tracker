# Budget Tracker

## Description

The budget tracker is an application that allows users to track their incomes and expenses though a simple and intuitive interface. Users will simply enter a transaction then will be presented with a graphical representation of their budget.

Data for the budget tracker app is persisted in a database so consecutice visits to the budget tracker will still show their previously entered transactions. Users may also still make transactions offline to be later stored in the database once the app reconnects to the internet. 

## Demo

The live deployed application can be found [HERE](https://budget-tracker-kb.herokuapp.com/).
